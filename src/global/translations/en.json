          "answer": "Yes, as long you fund the escrow with enough collateral funds, you can virtually trade with an unlimited number of Binance accounts. You can operate all your rented accounts automatically by API or manually on the TradeSharing dashboard."

          "question": "How does TradeSharing protect my money?",
          "answer": "To ensure your profits, each user who wants to rent an account on TradeSharing is required to first deposit collateral funds into an escrow. If your strategy generates profit, TradeSharing will be able to pay out your profits by taking funds from the escrow and eliminating counterparty risk."
        },
        "5": {
          "question": "Why do I need to deposit collateral to rent a Binance account?",
          "answer": "Once you rent a Binance account, you’re paying for the right to use the funds available on a trading account. However, you’re still responsible for the losses on this account. So, to protect the Binance accounts owners' funds, you’re required to fund an escrow with up to 100% of the rented account balance. If you return an account with losses, TradeSharing will be able to cover the negative balance by taking funds from the escrow."

          "question": "How much money can I trade?",

          "question": "How can I access rented Binance accounts?",
